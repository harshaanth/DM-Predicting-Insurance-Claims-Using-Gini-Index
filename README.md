# Predicting-Insurance-Claims-Using-Gini-Index
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer would make an insurance claim using a decision tree model based on the Gini index. The Gini index is used to evaluate the quality of potential splits in the dataset, ultimately leading to a decision tree that classifies whether a claim will be made.
